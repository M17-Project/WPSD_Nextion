# Nextion Development

## What is Nextion

Nextion is a Human Machine Interface （HMI） solution combining an onboard processor and memory touch display with Nextion Editor software for HMI GUI project development.

Nextion displays are the most commonly used display by makers and DIYers in the MMDVM ecosphere.  If you purchased an MMDVM complete from a manufacturer and it has a "Nextion" screen, it is more than likely a TJC screen.  Although the two screens are physically interchangeable, the software is not.  The software used to create/edit a TJC image is written in Chinese, so unlike Nextion screens, options are very limited and the ability to create custom screens is pretty much out of the question.

Using the Nextion Editor software, you can quickly develop the HMI GUI by drag-and-drop components (graphics, text, button, slider, etc.) and ASCII text-based instructions for coding how components interact on the display side.

Nextion HMI display connects to the MMDVI modem via TTL Serial (5V, TX, RX, GND) to provide event notifications that Modem can act on, the MMDVM modem can easily update progress, and status back to Nextion display utilizing simple ASCII text-based instructions.
